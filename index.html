    <h2>Vision over Goals</h2>
    <p>Hey,its S.T.R Nathan here</p>
</section>

<section id="resources">
    <h2>Recommended Resources</h2>
    <h1>Physics </h1>
    <p>Physics is everywhere in the surrounding,the fans,the racing cars,the aeroplanes,the watch,the coffe mug on your desk,you can see physics in most of the systemic surroundings,so how do you learn it,for competitive exams and board exams
   , speaking of board exams you got get ghat ncert,do every illusttand and exercise questions,next up my recommendation would be physics galaxy,read the theory and go for illustrations,if you want to solve the problems in it,but solve with time limit,next would ne irodov if you want something nice to solve</p>
    <h1>Organic Chemistry</h1>
    <p>Organic Chemistry is a subject that i gave the least importance in 11th,but later i understood that it is a mark improver,stidy ncert first dont go for foreign authors when it comes to theory, study reaction mechanism from Peter Skyes after studying ncert,next up solve all conversion questions in ncert,next for problem solving you can go for ms chouhan or jee mains and advanced pyqs,get some Reagent list from internet,or make your own notes on reagents,next up use Feynman technique for all chemical reactions of ncert, conversion,wrote them down on a paper,thats it just do it dont wait for the perfect time dont procrastinate</p>
    <h1>Physical Chemistry</h1>
    <p>Physical Chemistry is a subject that is a combination of theory and problems,but i feel that you need theory but uts mainly calculation so improve that,refrer btuce m mahan for theory,but prior to that do ncert,next solve ncert questions and then rc mukherjee</p>
    <h1>Inorganic Chemistr</h1>
    <p>Inorganic chemistry is memorization,if you think so then i guess you are wrong,first stidy periodic properties from clas 11th ncert textbook,next go for all ncert chapters and memorize them using Feynman technique,once this id done make ankidroid flashcards and review them ona regular basis,solve many problem from jee mains and advanced pyqs and vk jaiswal </p>
    <h1>Mathematics</h1>
    <p>Mathematics is about the concept and pronlem solving,just solve as many problems as you can from any standard reference book</p>
