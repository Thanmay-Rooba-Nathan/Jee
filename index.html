            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Thanmay, a 12th Standard student aiming for 98.4% in my board exams and a perfect 300 in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. My journey hasn't been without challenges. I attempted IOQM with just three days of prep and scored 16/100, but it was a lesson learned. Despite my current score of around 120/300 in JEE Mains mocks (which I consider below average), I am motivated to improve.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I have a tendency to dive deep into theory and avoid problems due to a fear of solving, I know that has to change. I am inspired by Chirag Falor to shift from being a consumer to a creator. I want to share my knowledge and experiences to help fellow JEE aspirants. Though my grades may not scream ‘top ranker,’ I believe in myself and am determined to keep growing.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those reading this, take my advice with a grain of salt – I am still learning. Yet, I have a vision that goes beyond exams and results. I am driven by a passion to contribute positively to my nation and the world, inspired by a deep entrepreneurial spirit.

            <h2>My Vision</h2>
            <p>
                I am not here just to study for exams. I want to build something meaningful, to help and inspire others, and to create rather than consume. Success is not just about scoring high; it’s about growing, contributing, and becoming a better version of myself every day. I am motivated by a vision of a brighter future, where I can play a part in the positive transformation of my nation and the world.

                To everyone out there who doubts themselves – remember, even small steps taken consistently can lead to great achievements.
